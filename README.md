# E-commerce Back End
Module 13 is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) challenge which consists of the building of an e-commerce site's backend using Express.js and Sequelize.

## User Story
`AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
`

## Description
On the database of this e-commerce site, you should be able to search for categories, products, their tags, as well as add, update, and delete them. To do this, log into your MySql account and run source schema.sql to create the database. Then, before accessing the database and using it, you should enter your MySql password into the .env file. Once that is done, you can access the database and run seed commands to seed the database with test data. Using Insomnia Core, you should be able to use the API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Routes to create, update, and delete data in the site's database.
